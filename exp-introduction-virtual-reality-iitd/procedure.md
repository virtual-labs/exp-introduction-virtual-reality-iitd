- Some VR systems support networking for multi-user shared virtual spaces, enabling collaborative or social experiences.
- VR components work together to engage multiple senses, creating a realistic virtual world.

# About Virtual Worlds

A **Virtual World** is a simulated environment designed for user interaction within a VR system. Its components depend on its purpose, evolving from a creator’s concepts into a computer-generated experience. Immersion depends on the virtual world’s responsiveness to user actions, continuously updating to deepen engagement.

## Interaction
The realism of a virtual world relies on its responsiveness to user actions. Extensive interaction with objects, characters, and environments, facilitated by sensory inputs or physical movements, enhances the experience. The computer system interprets these inputs, updating the virtual world dynamically.

## Hardware
Hardware includes physical devices like head-mounted displays, cameras, and position-tracking sensors. These capture user interactions and relay them to the software for real-time updates to the virtual world.

## Software
Software manages the creation, modification, and interaction within the virtual world. The Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) renders visuals and supports interactions, while *motion to photon latency*—the time taken to reflect user movements in the virtual world—impacts the experience. High latency may cause motion sickness or nausea.

# Related Technologies

VR and its derivatives evolve continuously, as outlined in the 1994 **Reality-Virtuality Continuum** by Paul Milgram and Fumio Kishino [1]. This spectrum spans from fully virtual to fully real environments, with augmented experiences in between.

## Mixed Reality
Mixed Reality encompasses experiences blending real and virtual elements, existing between fully virtual (VR) and fully real environments. It includes:
- **Augmented Reality (AR):** Real-world environments enriched with virtual elements.
- **Augmented Virtuality (AV):** Virtual worlds enhanced with real-world elements.

## Augmented Reality
AR involves experiencing a real-world environment augmented with virtual elements, enabling unique interactions by integrating digital content into reality, unlike the fully synthetic VR experience.
